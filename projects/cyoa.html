            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Tuesday, January 18, 2022</p>
            <p>Mr. Mueller assigned my class to create a simple adventure game. Before this project was assigned, we were exposed to other examples of what the project could look like.
            The whole premise of the adventure games is that you choose the given options to keep continuing to the next step. This project requires a partner to work with.
            However, since some students were absent, a classmate of mine joined our group.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The requirements for the projects were there must be at least 10 files, at least one subdirectory, a Google drawing plan, and a README.md file. The README.md file's purpose is to show
            credits, the Google drawing plan, the purpose of the project, and lastly, the start of the adventure. </p>
            <!--You must define the terms that are hard for readers to understand-->
            <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
            <p>One of the hardest challenges I faced during the making of this project was planning the adventure. My partners and I took days to get the "final draft" ready, but we still made some changes.
            Communication with my partners was also a challenge. Since everybody works at different times, it is harder for the group to work together all at once. Making the 10+ files was also a challenge
            because knowing what to write for the adventure game requires time and agreement with each other. Every file needs to link to another file to either go back or to the next file. At first, there
            was some difficulty linking the files together. The links didn't take us to the right destination and it is a pain-staking process to go through.</p>
