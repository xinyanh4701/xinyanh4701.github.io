            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>For 12th grade, I enrolled in APCSA. For the Freedom Project, I had the ability to create anything as long as I got approval. This year, I partnered up with <a href="https://aronl9810.github.io/">Aron</a>. Together we created a player vs. environment first-person shooter game. The purpose of this blog is to show your progress of how I played my role of building that game.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>My biggest challenge for the Freedom Project was making the health bar. The objective for the health bar is to update the player's health with text inside to show how much health the player has. After finishing the tutorial, I ran the test to see if the health bar was working. Before testing the health bar, I assigned the keys, <code>z</code> and <code>x</code> to simulate as taking damage and healing the player. During the test, when I pressed the keys, <code>z</code> and <code>x</code>, the health bar was not adjusting to the player's health. To find if the player's health was updated, I used <code>Debug.Log()</code> to show the player's health in the console. The console showed that the player's health was decreasing, but on the frontend, there was no change. There was an error. The issue was there was a <code>NullReferenceException</code> error where the <code>Player GameObject</code> had no reference to the health bar. This took a while to understand what the <code>NullReferenceException</code> error means. After resolving that issue, the health bar was adjusted in the <code>Radial 360</code> style. In order for the health bar to function normally, the <code>Fill Method</code> should be <code>Horizontal</code>. Unfortunately, the health bar is not proportionate to the screen resolution. I testing the game on Free Aspect where the screen size of the game is not adjusted to <code>Full HD</code>, <code>4k</code>, etc. I had to recreate the health bar with simple looks. There were many instances where I had merge conflicts that made me rebuild the components again because we couldn't understand Unity merge conflict errors. For my next steps for the game, I should make the game more aesthetically pleasing. </p>

            <p>For my project, I am making an interactive cake game using Kaboom JS. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Kaboom JS in order to make the cake game.</p><br>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>My biggest challenge for the freedom project was to make the third scene of my game which was after you pressed the spacebar 100 times, the game will take you to the ending. At first, I built the counter to help the player keep track of how many times they have already pressed. The counter worked so, the next step was to create a conditional to make sure after 100 times the next scene will appear. First, the condition I wrote was <code>if(times = 100)</code>. Inside the condition, I wrote <code>go("ending")</code>. The <code>go</code> part means to switch to this scene I am specifying which is "ending". When I ran the code, I pressed the spacebar 100 times to make sure there is no error and there is an error. The ending scene did not appear. I looked at <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/">the Kaboom Js website</a> to find any information to help me solve the problem. I found out that my condition was incorrect because I only put one equal sign (this means x value is equal to x variable). I instead used three equal signs to make sure the value is both operands are the same type. I ran the test again with my newly revised condition which worked. For my next steps for the game, I should include more levels for the game to be more interactive. For example, another level could be cuting the cake.</p><br> -->
